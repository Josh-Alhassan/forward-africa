          <AboutCard title="About Website" image={formalEducation} description="AL-BISHAK, FORWARD AFRICA! counters doubt about Africa's historical achievements and current capabilities, citing misinformation and disinformation as obstacles. Eurasian records depict Africa negatively, attributing backwardness and misrule by African leaders to this perception. Undevelopment is seen as evidence of Africa's backwardness. Africanist writers are criticized for focusing on the era of Eurasian dominance, and mental slavery is identified as a major obstacle perpetuated since the 19th century. The correct history, according to the website, begins with Africa's earliest civilization and its leadership in the Egyptian Empire. Rather than lamenting, the website presents concrete achievements, relying on positive sentiments from intellectuals of all races, countering the prevailing negative propaganda against Africa. African-positive works by European intellectuals and African scholars are highlighted for their worth on the website." hrefLink="/aboutwebsite" />
