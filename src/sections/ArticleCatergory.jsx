At first, children were trained by their parents at home or their workshops to acquire skills of the parentsâ€™ trades. Gradually, as the children began to increase in different homesteads it was deemed necessary to create a place away from home where training could take place, and some trainers were hired to teach the pupils at such a place called school." />

The first translation of The Bible from Hebrew was by the Greeks in Alexandria, Egypt, who called it The Septuagint.  Later the Romans translated it into Latin known as The Vulgate Bible. Other translations and versions came later." />

The urban areas of Egypt are dominated by white-skinned Arabs. Arabs have governed Egypt since 639 CE when an army led by Amr bin al-Asd swept into the country from Arabia. The dominant culture you see is Mediterranean which integrates both Western and Arab ways of life. Geographers and cartographers used to say that Egypt belongs to Western or Arab civilization in the Mediterranean. " />
